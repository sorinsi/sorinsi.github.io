    <h3 id="#introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
       Most CI/CD examples use Fastlane to deploy the application however we will use Gitlab CI and Appcenter CLI to do everything which is way easier to configure.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>In this example we will only build and deploy for Android but I will try to give pointers on how to do it for iOS because the configuration won't change much between platforms.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Short summary of what we will be doing:
       <ol>
           <li>Test our React Native application</li>
           <li>Increment version code</li>
           <li>Set version name</li>
           <li>Build application for Android</li>
           <li>Set release notes</li>
           <li>Deploy the application to Beta</li>
       </ol>
    </p>
    <h3 id="#ci">Gitlab CI</h3>
    <p>
        We must define a base for our CI in order to be able to share the configuration between jobs.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Please read the comments in the code below for an explanation about what we do.   
    </p>
<code><pre>
# We will use this to rename our builds
variables:
  ANDROID_FILE: myapp.aab

stages:
  - test
  - build
  - deploy

# We want to save the node_modules files
# between jobs in order to save time
cache: &global_cache
  key: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
  paths:
    - node_modules/

# This is a template that can be reused for
# Android and iOS.
.job_template: &assemble
  stage: build
  # Only pull, previous job will already create the cache we need
  cache:
    <<: *global_cache
    policy: pull
  after_script:
    - cp $OUTPUT_PATH $FILE
  artifacts:
    name: $FILE
    paths:
    - $FILE
    expire_in: 5 days
  only:
    - tags
</pre></code>
<p>
    We will define the $FILE and $OUTPUT_PATH variable later.
</p>
    <h3 id="#test">Test</h3>
    <p>
        This is the easiest step. All we have to do is use the Alpine version of Node for Docker in order to test our application.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am using an older version of Node in this case because there are a few libraries that won't build correctly on
        newer versions.
    </p>
<code><pre>
test:
    image: node:10.19-alpine3.10
    stage: test
    cache:
        <<: *global_cache
        policy: pull-push
    only:
        - master
        - develop
        - tags
    script:
        - npm install
        - npm test
</pre></code>
    <h3 id="#test">Build</h3>
    <p>
        This is the most complex step in our example on how to put everything together.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all, check this official guide on <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android" target="_blank">"Publishing to Google Play Store"</a>. You need to generate a keystore in
        order to sign your application bundle and configure a few gradle properties that we will change later.
    </p>
    <p>
        After that you must prepare your envs and set them up in Gitlab in the CI & CD section. Please remember to not commit nor push your keystore to the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to use the keystore file in our pipeline we will encode it with base64.
    </p>
    <code><pre>
# You can export the base64 to a file or to stdout.
base64 myapp.keystore > base64keystore.txt
    </pre></code>
    <code>vim base64keystore.txt</code>
    <p>
        Copy the content of base64keystore.txt and save it as a file in the variables section in Gitlab. 
        You also need to set up <strong>KEYSTORE_PASSWORD</strong> and <strong>KEYSTORE_ALIAS</strong> there (I will be using the same string for storePassword and keyPassword).
    </p>
    <p>
        Now instead of using gradle.properties to retrieve the keystore alias, path and password for our build we will use the ENV.
    </p>
<code><pre>
def keystorePath = System.getenv("MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE")
</pre></code>
<code><pre>
storePassword System.getenv("KEYSTORE_PASSWORD")
keyAlias System.getenv("KEYSTORE_ALIAS")
keyPassword System.getenv("KEYSTORE_PASSWORD")
</pre></code>
<code><pre>
versionCode System.getenv("MYAPP_VERSION_CODE") as Integer ?: 1
versionName System.getenv("MYAPP_VERSION_NAME") ?: "0.0.0"
</pre></code>
<p>
    Once we have gradle ready to accept envs we write the bash script needed in order to work with our CI.
</p>
<code><pre>
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

if [[ -z "$CI_COMMIT_TAG" ]] && [[ -z "$KEYSTORE_ALIAS" ]] && [[ -z "$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD" ]] && [[ -z "$KEYSTORE" ]]
then
    echo "You forgot to define a few envs"
    exit 1
fi

if [[ $CI_COMMIT_TAG =~ ^[0-9]{1,2}.[0-9]{1,2}.[0-9]{1,2}$ ]]
then
    TAGS_COUNT=`git tag | wc -l`

    # If you already have a few versions on the Play Store you can use an initial
    # version and start from there.
    VERSION_CODE=$(( 11 + $TAGS_COUNT ))

    # Could be a random string
    KEYSTORE_NAME=myapp.keystore

    echo "Retrieving tags count ($TAGS_COUNT) to use for application version code"

    # Gradle fails to find vars passed from Gitlab
    # Thats why we export it again here
    export MYAPP_VERSION_CODE=$VERSION_CODE
    export MYAPP_VERSION_NAME=$CI_COMMIT_TAG
    export MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=$KEYSTORE_NAME
    export KEYSTORE_ALIAS=$KEYSTORE_ALIAS
    export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD

    base64 -d $KEYSTORE > ./android/app/$KEYSTORE_NAME

    echo "Building with version code $MYAPP_VERSION_CODE and version name $MYAPP_VERSION_NAME"
    cd android && ./gradlew clean && ./gradlew bundleRelease
else
    echo "Incorrect tag"
    exit 1
fi
</pre></code>
<p>
    With the bash script done (I named it build-release.sh) the only thing left to set up is our CI job.
</p>
<code><pre>
android:build:
  image: sopromo/react-native:1.0
  variables:
    FILE: $ANDROID_FILE
    OUTPUT_PATH: android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app.aab
  <<: *assemble
  script:
    - bash build-release.sh

</pre></code>
    <h3 id="#test">Deploy</h3>
    <p>
        For deployment we will use <a href="https://appcenter.ms/" target="_blank">Appcenter</a> which is free for us. You should have an account there (it isn't required to give them
        any access to your repository).
    </p>
    <p>
        After creating an account you should follow their guide to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/stores/googleplay" target="_blank">connect the Google Play Store with the Appcenter</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now configure a new variable in the Gitlab variables section and add your Appcenter token there.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only thing left to do now is configure the CI to deploy our application to a track (Alpha, Beta, Production).
    </p>
    <code><pre>
android:beta:
  image: sopromo/node-appcenter-git:alpine
  stage: deploy
  cache: {}
  only:
    - tags
  dependencies:
    - android:build
  needs:
    - job: android:build
      artifacts: true
  script:
    # We extract the release notes for this version from the tag message.
    - export TAG_MESSAGE=$(git tag -l --format='%(contents)' $CI_COMMIT_TAG)
    - appcenter login --token $APPCENTER_TOKEN
    - appcenter distribute stores publish --file $ANDROID_FILE --store Beta --app APPCENTER_APP --release-notes "$TAG_MESSAGE"
    </pre></code>
    <p>
        And we are mostly done now.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever you need to launch a new version you have to create a tag with a title that follows <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">semantic versioning</a> and
        if you need to add release notes with your version in the Play Store you can add a message to your tag and it will be added too.
    </p>
    <h3 id="#test">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        I wrote this example because it may be easier to understand and setup your CI/CD pipeline with this guide and you don't have to use
        third parties to build your application or test it.
    </p>
    <p>
        You could also remove the Appcenter dependency from the pipeline by using the Play Store API directly or simply use Gradle to do everything.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope you enjoyed reading this guide, have a wonderful day!
