    <h4 id="#introduction">Introduction</h4>
    
    <p>
        Before we start I have to say that I’m using Docker for this because it very easy to have
        multiple instances running at the same time with it.
    </p><p>
        In this introduction I will try to show you how to configure the Streaming Replication
        technique and different paths you can take to set it up.
    </p><p>
        Streaming Replication works by streaming WAL records as soon as possible instead of
        waiting for the complete WAL file to be filled. This comes with its advantages and
        disadvantages and you have to choose accordingly. One big advantage is that it allows
        the replicas to stay more up to date with the master and one big disadvantage is that
        exclusive locks on master will conflict with queries on the read-only replica.
    </p><p>
        In my personal opinion, file-based log shipping would be better to use only when you
        want to have a live backup of the primary database because if you want to use it for a
        read-only replica you have a bigger window for problems to slip in with inconsistencies
        and data loss if the master fails.
    </p>

    <h4 id="docker">Docker configuration</h4>
    
    <p>
        Now we have to configure our containers in order to connect a master and replica
        together.
    </p>

    <code>
        > docker run -d --name master --publish-all --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root --volume ~/Desktop/master:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:latest
    </code>
    <code>
        > docker run -d --name replica --publish-all --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root --volume ~/Desktop/replica:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:latest
    </code>

    <p>
        I am using —name flag to give a name to each container because we are going to use
        that name later and it is easier to access and complete the configuration if we don’t have
        to copy the container id. The —publish-all flag is to to publish all exposed ports to a
        random port in order to be able to access it and the —volume flag to persist data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we must connect both containers to the same network.
    </p>
    <code>
        > docker network create demo
    </code>
    <code>
        > docker network connect demo master
    </code>
    <code>
        > docker network connect demo master
    </code>
    <code>
        > docker container ls
    </code>
    <code>
        <table >
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>CONTAINER ID</th>
                    <th>IMAGE</th>
                    <th>COMMAND</th>
                    <th>CREATED</th>
                    <th>STATUS</th>
                    <th>PORTS</th>
                    <th>NAMES</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0946e750ae4a</td>
                    <td>postgres:latest</td>
                    <td>"docker-entrypoint.s..."</td>
                    <td>About a minute ago</td>
                    <td>Up About a minute</td>
                    <td>0.0.0.0:32785->5432/tcp</td>
                    <td>replica</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>6aa67f9cd254</td>
                    <td>postgres:latest</td>
                    <td>"docker-entrypoint.s..."</td>
                    <td>About a minute ago</td>
                    <td>Up About a minute</td>
                    <td>0.0.0.0:32784->5432/tcp</td>
                    <td>master</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </code>
    <p>
        We can see that our containers are exposed at port 32785 and 32784 for
        us but we also need the internal IP where containers communicate between
        themselves:
    </p>
    <code>
        > docker network inspect --format '{{range $k, $v := .Containers}} (Name: {{$v.Name}} - IP: {{$v.IPv4Address}}) {{end}}' demo
    </code>
    <code>
        (Name: replica - IP: 172.21.0.3/16) (Name: master - IP: 172.21.0.2/16)
    </code>
    <p>
        We extracted the IPs (172.21.0.*) needed and the subnet mask (/16).
    </p>
    <h4 id="master">Master configuration</h4>
    <p>
        In order to configure the master correctly we must create a new user with replication
        permissions and in order to do that we have to run the following commands:
    </p>
    <code>
        > docker exec -it master su - postgres
    </code>
    <code>
        > psql
    </code>
    <code>
        > create role repl with replication login encrypted password ‘secret’;
    </code>
    <p>
        We connected to the container, changed the user to Postgres and executed a query that
        creates a new user for our database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we would have to modify a few lines in the postgresql.conf file but Postgres 12
        comes with defaults that allow us to move forward without configuring too much but if
        you want to make sure that your configuration is good you should make sure that you
        have the following configuration:
    </p>
    <p>
        wal_level = replica<br/>
        max_replication_slots > 0<br/>
        max_wal_senders > 0
    </p>
    <p>
        You should change the values accordingly to your setup and number of replicas. A zero
        value usually means that it will be disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
        To configure the access for the replication user in order to allow connections in the
        pg_hba.conf file we must add the following line at the end:
    </p>
    <code>
        <table >
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>TYPE</th>
                    <th>DATABASE</th>
                    <th>USER</th>
                    <th>ADDRESS</th>
                    <th>METHOD</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>host</td>
                    <td>replication</td>
                    <td>repl</td>
                    <td>172.21.0.3/16</td>
                    <td>md5</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </code>
    <p>
        Once we modified all this files we have to restart Postgres in order to load the correct
        configuration files, we can either do this with Docker or pg_ctl, in this case I will do it with
        Docker:
    </p>
    <code>
        > docker container restart master
    </code>
    <h4 id="replica">Replica configuration</h4>
    <p>
        In order to use our replica we must make an initial backup first by using the
        pg_basebackup command:
    </p>
    <code>
        > docker exec -it replica bash
    </code>
    <code>
        > pg_basebackup -h 172.21.0.2 -U repl -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -P -R
    </code>
    <p>
        You have to use the -R flag because it will create all the necessary files for the replica (a
        standby.signal file) and when it finishes copying files we will have everything ready.
    </p>
    <p>
        I won’t explain how to configure Postgres for high availability or for failover because it is
        outside the scope of this introduction to replication but you can configure the
        restore_command, archive_command and have a promote_trigger_file to automatically
        promote the replica to master or do it manually.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I say that it is outside of the scope of this introduction to show that it is because
        you have to control what happens in the case that master fails and replica assumes that
        position and after that master wakes again or what happens if master fails and replica
        fails too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having said that, you should also consider which type of streaming would be better for
        your architecture. You can use async or sync, if data consistency matters above all else
        you may be better off using this technique in a sync mode instead of using the default
        async mode. Using sync comes at the cost of performance because master will wait until
        everything is committed to all replicas.
    </p>
    <h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
        This was a very small introduction on how to configure a master and replica and keeping
        them up to date using the Streaming Replication technique in async mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes it is easier to just use a DaaS (Database as a Service) but if you have the time to learn about the software you’re using it
        may cost less to maintain it by yourself and have the correct configuration for your
        architecture.
